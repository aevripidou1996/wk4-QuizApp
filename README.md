# wk4-QuizApp

##Description
This is a submission for my homework for week 4

In this assignnment i was tasked with creating a quiz app using JavaScript, html & css.

I was able to acheive this with the help of arrays, if statments, functions and many more elements used in javascript.

As a result of this i was able to creat a quiz app that has a countdown timmer, capable of storing score reccords and names as well as act as a multiple choice questionaire.
